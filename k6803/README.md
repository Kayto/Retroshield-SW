# Retroshield 6803
 Some simple routines, nothing too complex but helpful to get things going.
 Code is not very optimised so feel free to tinker.
 It took me a long time to get serial i/o working so there are various serial routines.
 simple_serial_io_test.asm seems to be the best working example at the moment.
## MONITOR ROMS
 There are a number of existing ROMs available such as MIKBUG, MINIBUG but not offering much over the BILLBUG rom. I may create a custo monitor at some point but thats a longer term plan.
## COOKBOOK routines
I have made a start on collating more useful routines from the book 6800_Software_Gourmet_Guide_and_Cookbook_1976_Robert_Findley.
These are currently roughly transcribed from OCR so contain some errors.
